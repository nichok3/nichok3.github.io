    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi! I'm Nick, a 4th-year undergraduate Computer Science student at <em>University of California, Irvine</em>, graduating December 2022.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm taking a full-time student course load and am working part-time as a DevOps Software Engineering Intern at <a href = "https://www.dhl.com/us-en/home/ecommerce-solutions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> DHL eCommerce Solutions</a>. 
      After graduating I will be joining <a href = "https://www.palantir.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palantir</a> fulltime as a Product Reliability Engineer. I'm not currently looking for any work, 
      but if you have any cool or unique opportunities or if you would like to chat, feel free to contact me <a href = "pages/contact.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>In my freetime, I love to stay active and deep dive into new topics. Right now, I have a heavy interest in Formula 1 and sim-racing.</p>
